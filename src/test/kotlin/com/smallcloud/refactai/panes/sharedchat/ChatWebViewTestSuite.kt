         * Test execution summary and validation criteria:
         * 
         * 1. Memory Leak Tests:
         *    - Should not leak more than 50MB for 5 instances
         *    - All weak references should be cleared after GC
         *    - Repeated initialization/disposal should be stable
         * 
         * 2. Performance Tests:
         *    - OSR rendering should maintain 30+ FPS on Linux
         *    - JavaScript execution should average <5ms
         *    - Message handling should process 100+ msg/s
         *    - CPU usage should stay under 80%
         * 
         * 3. Thread Safety Tests:
         *    - Concurrent initialization should not cause exceptions
         *    - Race conditions in load handlers should be prevented
         *    - State management should be atomic
         *    - Concurrent disposal should be safe
         * 
         * 4. Disposal Chain Tests:
         *    - All resources should be properly cleaned up
         *    - Multiple disposal calls should be safe
         *    - Disposal during initialization should not hang
         *    - JS queries should be disposed before browser
         * 
         * 5. Component Lifecycle Tests:
         *    - Components should be properly initialized
         *    - Component state should be maintained correctly
         *    - Cleanup should be complete on disposal
         *    - Memory usage should be reasonable
         * 
         * All tests should pass for the implementation to be considered robust
         * and production-ready.
